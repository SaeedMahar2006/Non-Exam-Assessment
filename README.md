This is my NEA submission for AQA Computer Science A Level

Purpose:
I wanted to provide an example of a project so that future students could take inspiration from it and help with their own coursework. I was awarded 75/75 marks, and this is an example of a project to achieve this mark for students that want this.
I am proud of this project that I undertook, and would like to share it with the world.


What is it:
This is an implementation of 2 different Machine Learning algorithms: NEAT and simple Back propagation for FFNNs. Both are implement the INeuralNetwork interface and allow for those interested to implement more algorithms. Both make use of parallel processing for training.

The current implementation includes 3 types of datasets, and your own dataset must be converted to the appropriate C# object before you can use it to train. This means I only implemented labeled data training, but I welcome if you wish to add unlabelled data set support or training agents.

The GUI is made in Win Forms and is only officially supported on Windows, although you could try run it on other OS using Wine.


Installation:
git clone https://github.com/SaeedMahar2006/Non-Exam-Assessment
cd Non-Exam-Assessment
dotnet build


TODO:
Add my NEA documentation after I censor sensitive parts
